## Simple Tailwind/PHP Dev Area for HTML Templates/Components

# Requirements 

* PHP installed is helpful. 
* run 'npm install' or whatever package manager you use.
* Scripts include 'watch', 'build' and 'serve'.
* Watch: watches for changes and builds CSS
* Build: builds without watching - but basically the same thing... 
* Serve: just spins up a simple PHP server so you can view your stuff.

## The Concept. 

Simple way to quickly get creating components for your PHP / Tailwind dev places.  

## The Flow...

Create a component then include it into the index area, like the default component you can see.  
Create elements and include them into components.

Build your dreams and make unicorns fly. 

## Profit. 

Well maybe, basically just have fun.
